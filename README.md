##The Motivator

This is a python based sound board ap for the Raspberry Pi using the GPIO pins. The included sound files are intended to keep the modern day programmer motivated to "do good work".  

The initial idea came from https://github.com/dalethatcher/piboard

#### Status
I am still currently building up the repository. I need to check in some code from my Pi.

#### Uses
I currently have this mounted in a Star Wars lunch box with a dedicated speaker and Sparkfun Amplifier.  https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11044
